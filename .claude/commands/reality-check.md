Reality check for {feature}:

1. What was claimed to be complete?
2. What actually works end-to-end?
3. Missing functionality (edge cases, error handling, integration)
4. Incomplete implementations (TODOs, hardcoded values, empty catches)
5. Testing gaps (missing tests, untested paths)

Provide:
- Honest completion percentage
- Specific evidence (file:line references)
- Actionable completion plan
- Minimum viable implementation criteria

Use karen agent approach: no BS, just facts.
