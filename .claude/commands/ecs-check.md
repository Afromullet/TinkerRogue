Please analyze the following for ECS compliance:
- Pure data components (no methods)
- EntityID usage (not entity pointers)
- Query-based relationships (not stored references)
- System-based logic (not component methods)
- Value map keys (not pointer keys)

Target: {file or package name}

Provide:
1. Violations found with priority (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
2. Code examples showing violations
3. Recommended fixes referencing squad/inventory systems
4. Quick wins vs strategic improvements

Use strict ECS principles from CLAUDE.md.
