The example code had a number of variables declared globally in world.go

var position *ecs.Component
var renderable *ecs.Component
var monster *ecs.Component
var health *ecs.Component
var meleeWeapon *ecs.Component
var armor *ecs.Component
var name *ecs.Component
var userMessage *ecs.Component


I think that was just done to avoid having to inititalize it every time it's references. Modifying the code to use local references to see if I'm correct in thinking that.
