## Simplification Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed (6/7 items - 90% overall)
1. **Input System** - Unified InputCoordinator with specialized controllers
2. **Coordinate System** - Type-safe LogicalPosition/PixelPosition with CoordinateManager
3. **Entity Templates** - Generic factory pattern with EntityType enum (283 LOC)
4. **Graphics Shapes** - Consolidated 8+ types into BaseShape with 3 variants (390 LOC)
5. **Position System** - O(1) spatial grid, 50x performance improvement (399 LOC)
6. **Inventory System** - ECS refactor: EntityIDs, system functions, pure data (533 LOC) - 2025-10-21

### üîÑ In Progress (0/7 items)
(None - Status Effects moved to low priority)

### ‚ùå Remaining (1/7 items)
7. **GUI Button Factory** - 10% complete, needs ButtonConfig pattern

### üìã Low Priority / Optional
- **Status Effects** - 85% complete, needs quality interface extraction (deferred)

## Squad System Status: 85% Complete (2358 LOC)

**Operational NOW:**
- ‚úÖ All 8 ECS components with perfect data/logic separation
- ‚úÖ Query system (7 functions) - Find units, check positions, get leaders
- ‚úÖ Combat system - ExecuteSquadAttack with hit/dodge/crit/cover mechanics
- ‚úÖ Visualization - Text-based 3x3 grid rendering
- ‚úÖ Testing infrastructure - Comprehensive test suite exists

**Remaining Work (12-16 hours):**
- ‚ùå Ability System (8-10h) - Auto-triggering leader abilities (abilities.go doesn't exist)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Formation Presets (4-6h) - Balanced/Defensive/Offensive/Ranged templates

**Key Achievement:** Squad combat fully operational and tested in isolation (no map dependency)

**Timeline:** 2-3 workdays for completion + map integration

## ECS Best Practices (Squad & Inventory System Templates)

The squad and inventory systems demonstrate perfect ECS architecture. Apply these patterns to all new code:

1. **Pure Data Components** - Zero logic methods, only data fields
2. **Native EntityID** - Use `ecs.EntityID` everywhere, not pointers
3. **Query-Based Relationships** - Discover via ECS queries, don't store references
4. **System-Based Logic** - All behavior in systems, not component methods
5. **Value Map Keys** - Use value-based keys for O(1) performance

**Anti-Patterns Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Position system: Pointer map keys ‚Üí Value keys (50x faster)
- ‚úÖ Legacy weapon/creature components removed (replaced by squad system)
- ‚úÖ Inventory system: Entity pointers ‚Üí EntityIDs, methods ‚Üí system functions (2025-10-21)
- ‚úÖ Item.Properties: `*ecs.Entity` ‚Üí `ecs.EntityID` (2025-10-21)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Equipment system still uses entity pointers (scheduled for refactoring)

**Reference Implementations:**
- `squads/*.go` - Perfect ECS: 2358 LOC, 8 components, 7 query functions, system-based combat
- `gear/Inventory.go` - Perfect ECS: 241 LOC, pure data component, 9 system functions
- `gear/items.go` - Perfect ECS: 177 LOC, EntityID-based relationships
- `gear/gearutil.go` - Perfect ECS: 115 LOC, query-based entity lookup

## Current Implementation Priorities

### Ready to Implement (No Blockers)
- Bug fixes: throwable AOE, entity cleanup on death, wall collision
- Throwing accuracy/miss chance system
- Level transitions and tile variety
- Spawning system improvements (Entity Template System unblocked this)

### Blocked/Waiting
- **Squad abilities & formations** (12-16h remaining)
- **Balance/difficulty** (needs squad combat complete)
- **Map integration for squads** (4-6h after abilities done)

## Analysis Files Reference

**Primary:** `analysis/MASTER_ROADMAP.md` v3.0 (2025-10-12)
- Executive summary: 16-24 hours remaining for squad completion
- Phase breakdown with actual LOC counts from codebase audit
- Critical discoveries: Position/Query/Combat/Visualization already complete

**Supporting:**
- `squad_system_final.md` - Architecture details (components, abilities, targeting)
- `combat_refactoring.md` - OBSOLETE (combat implemented)
- `roadmap_completion.md` - OBSOLETE (superseded by v3.0)

**Note:** v3.0 based on actual file analysis, not estimates.
