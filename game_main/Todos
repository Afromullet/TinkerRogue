__Throwing__


* Miss chance - tile isn't always hit



__Movement__



* Add Movement Speed so that sticky effect works

* Add Keep Distance movement - Move within N Square

* Add Pack Movement - Only approach if N mothers are within r distance to the player

* Hit and Run - Attack then flee

* Fix bug that causes a creature to teleport if it tries to move into a blocked spot

* Add a function to add a movement component to a creature. The function checks if there are any existing movement components and
then removes them before adding the new one

* Make it easier to add new movement types

__Monster Bevavior__



* Allow Creatures to do ranged attacks

* Monster can chose to melee attack, range attack, or throw

* Allow creature to choose its target. Currently the attacks use the PlayerData

__Randomness__

* Item Spawning - Determine where to spawn items and spawn with random properties

* Creature Spawning - Spawn during map gen and when out of 


__Levels__

Add multiple levels

Add more variety to the levels, including placeable items and tile variety

....Note....

Currently I create two slices of images. One from assets/tiles/walls and another from assets/tiles/floors.  The GameMap chooses a random tile to draw.  Also loading images from assets/tiles/decorations to add a small amount of flair. 
Not very complicated, but it will do for now.

__Component__

* Better organization of components and compontent initializaiton. Currently it's littered through the files

___Weapon and Armor__


* Equipping weapons and armor

___Consumables__

* Add consumables

__Animations__

Add shooting and throwing animations

___Other__

* Decouple functions which take g *Game as input

* Better organization of files


* Effect Stacking


* Check on calls to make where slice is initialized with a size greater than 0. See if it works as intended, where we're just adding to it. Using append.
Might need to index instead

* Clean up all functions and methods which use a large number of parameters

* Add information, such as attack hits, misses, and damage done to the UI

* Throwing and shooting passes around lots of state. Refactor it. Especially in the way we use PlayerData. Also anything related to the drawing

* Create Shorter names for types and functions with long names



* Do I want to add collision handling? Could make it easier to choose what tile to move to for creature movement

--- State Handlers --- 
* game struct needs improvement. It tracks a lot.

* player struct needs improvement. It tracks a lot

--- State Handlers End---
