# TinkerRogue Master Development Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-10-02
**Total Estimated Time:** 106-144 hours (13-18 workdays)
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State

TinkerRogue is a Go-based roguelike game using the Ebiten engine with an ECS architecture (bytearena/ecs). The project has achieved 80% completion of its simplification roadmap, with major accomplishments including:

- **Completed Systems:** Input consolidation, coordinate standardization, entity templates, graphics shapes
- **Architecture:** Proper ECS patterns with native entity ID usage, query-based relationships
- **Recent Achievement:** Entity Template System completed, unblocking spawning implementation
- **Code Quality:** Mixed - new code follows proper ECS patterns, legacy code needs migration

### Strategic Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Implement squad-based tactical combat system (similar to Symphony of War, Nephilim, Soul Nomad)
2. **Secondary Goals:** Complete todos implementation, finish simplification roadmap
3. **Architecture Goals:** Migrate legacy code to proper ECS patterns, achieve 100% pattern compliance

### Key Innovation: Testing Approach

**User wants to test squad building and combat BEFORE implementing map movement/representation.** This means:
- Squad creation and management can be tested in isolation
- Combat system can be validated without full map integration
- Map representation and movement come AFTER core squad mechanics are proven

### Total Time Estimate

- **Phase 0 (Prerequisites):** 4 hours
- **Phase 1 (Squad Core - Priority):** 36-48 hours
- **Phase 2 (Squad Integration):** 16-24 hours
- **Phase 3 (Legacy Refactoring):** 38-54 hours (can parallelize)
- **Phase 4 (Todos Implementation):** 8-12 hours
- **Phase 5 (Roadmap Completion):** 4 hours

**Total Sequential (Critical Path):** 60-92 hours
**Total Parallel Work Available:** 46-56 hours
**Overall Timeline:** 13-18 workdays

---

## Phase 0: Prerequisites and Setup

**Time Estimate:** 4 hours
**Dependencies:** None
**Can Start:** Immediately

### Deliverables

1. Complete GUI Button Factory (2 hours)
2. Complete Status Effects Quality Interface (2 hours)

### Why These First?

These are quick wins that complete the simplification roadmap and provide confidence-building momentum before tackling the major squad system implementation. Neither blocks any other work.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] GUI Button Factory: 3 duplicate functions consolidated into 1 factory with ButtonConfig pattern
- [ ] Status Effects: Quality interface extracted, effects no longer coupled to loot quality system
- [ ] Simplification roadmap progress: 80% â†’ 95%
- [ ] Net code reduction: -35 lines
- [ ] Build succeeds, game runs without errors

### Testing Approach

- Verify all three menu buttons work identically after factory refactoring
- Confirm loot generation still applies quality correctly after extraction
- Run `go test ./...` to ensure no regressions

### Testing Strategy (Isolated from Map)

**Create test file: `systems/squad_integration_test.go`**

```go
func TestSquadCombatWithoutMap(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup ECS manager
    manager := ecs.NewManager()
    ecsmanager := setupTestECS(manager)

    // Create two squads (no map positions needed)
    playerSquad := CreateSquadFromTemplate(
        ecsmanager,
        "Player Squad",
        FORMATION_BALANCED,
        coords.LogicalPosition{X: 0, Y: 0}, // Dummy position
        createTestUnitTemplates(),
    )

    enemySquad := CreateSquadFromTemplate(
        ecsmanager,
        "Enemy Squad",
        FORMATION_DEFENSIVE,
        coords.LogicalPosition{X: 1, Y: 1}, // Dummy position
        createEnemyUnitTemplates(),
    )

    // Test combat without any map interaction
    result := ExecuteSquadAttack(playerSquad, enemySquad, ecsmanager)

    assert.Greater(t, result.TotalDamage, 0)
    assert.GreaterOrEqual(t, len(result.DamageByUnit), 1)

    // Test abilities trigger
    CheckAndTriggerAbilities(playerSquad, ecsmanager)

    // Validate results
}
```

**Key Insight:** All core squad mechanics can be tested with dummy positions, no map integration required.

**Dependencies:** None for most items
**Can Parallelize:** With Phase 1 or Phase 2
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium

### Strategic Value

Migrating legacy code to proper ECS patterns improves performance, maintainability, and consistency with the new squad system architecture. These refactorings can happen in parallel with squad implementation.

### Refactoring Items

#### 3.1: Position System (8-12 hours) - HIGHEST IMPACT

**Status:** 0% â†’ 100%
**Priority:** 1 (highest performance impact)
**Can Start:** Anytime

**Problem:**
- Current PositionTracker uses pointer keys: `map[*coords.LogicalPosition]*ecs.Entity`
- O(n) linear search for entity lookups
- 50x slower than necessary with 50+ entities

**Solution:**
- Create PositionSystem with entity ID-based spatial grid
- Hash-based lookup: `map[coords.LogicalPosition][]ecs.EntityID`
- O(1) position queries

**Impact:**
- 50+ monsters: O(50) â†’ O(1) = 50x performance improvement
- Enables efficient squad positioning
- Required for performant multi-squad gameplay

**Testing:**
- Benchmark position lookups before/after
- Verify all combat position queries still work
- Test with 100+ entities to validate performance

#### 3.2: Weapon System (12-16 hours) - HIGH IMPACT

**Status:** 0% â†’ 100%
**Priority:** 2 (most frequently called code)
**Can Start:** Anytime

**Problem:**
- Weapon components have logic methods (CalculateDamage, GetTargets)
- Returns entity pointers instead of IDs
- Anti-pattern: logic in components, not systems

**Solution:**
- Create WeaponSystem struct with all weapon logic
- Remove methods from MeleeWeapon and RangedWeapon components
- Return entity IDs from target queries

**Impact:**
- Aligns weapons with squad combat patterns
- Enables proper weapon integration with squads
- Template for other system migrations

**Testing:**
- Verify damage calculation matches old behavior
- Test with existing combat system
- Integrate with squad combat system

#### 3.3: Item System (10-14 hours) - MEDIUM IMPACT

**Status:** 0% â†’ 100%
**Priority:** 3 (completes roadmap item)
**Can Start:** Anytime

**Problem:**
- Item.Properties is nested entity pointer
- Query logic in component methods
- Anti-pattern: nested entity hierarchy

**Solution:**
- Flatten Item structure with inline effect data
- Create ItemSystem for all item logic
- Use entity IDs for item references

**Impact:**
- Completes Status Effects roadmap item (85% â†’ 100%)
- Removes nested entity anti-pattern
- Prepares for quality-based item spawning

**Testing:**
- Verify item creation still works
- Test effect application
- Validate quality system integration

#### 3.4: Movement System (8-12 hours) - MEDIUM IMPACT

**Status:** 0% â†’ 100%
**Priority:** 4 (organizational improvement)
**Recommended After:** Position System complete

**Problem:**
- Creature.UpdatePosition method contains 30+ lines of logic
- Movement logic in component, not system
- Anti-pattern: behavior in data structure

**Solution:**
- Create MovementSystem struct
- Move all movement logic to system
- Remove methods from Creature component

**Impact:**
- Prepares for squad formations and movement
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Benefits from Position System optimization

**Testing:**
- Verify creature pathfinding works
- Test with existing AI
- Validate position updates correct

### Success Criteria (Phase 3 Complete)

- [ ] Item System: Flat item structure, no nested entities
- [ ] Movement System: All movement logic in MovementSystem
- [ ] All legacy code follows proper ECS patterns
- [ ] Zero component methods remaining (except pure helpers)
- [ ] Native entity IDs used throughout

### Parallelization Strategy

**Can work on Phase 3 while Phase 1 is in progress:**
- Different files, no conflicts
- Position System doesn't touch squad code
- Weapon System can be tested independently
- Only merges at Phase 2 (squad integration)

**Recommended parallel approach:**
- Week 1: Phase 0 (4h) + start Phase 1 (16h) + start Position System (8h)
- Week 2: Continue Phase 1 (20h) + complete Position System (4h) + start Weapon System (8h)

## Appendix: Key Design Decisions

### Why Squad Testing Before Map Integration?

**User Requirement:** Test squad building and combat in isolation first.

**Benefits:**
- Validate core mechanics without rendering complexity
- Faster iteration on combat balance
- Easier debugging (fewer moving parts)
- Can change squad mechanics without touching map code

**Approach:**
- Phase 1 creates squads with dummy positions
- Combat tested via unit tests and programmatic execution
- Map integration deferred to Phase 2

### Why Multi-Cell Units?

**Strategic Value:**
- Boss variety (2x2 giants, 3x3 dragons)
- Tactical positioning (large units control more rows)
- Visual distinctiveness (big units look impressive)

**Implementation:**
- GridPositionData has Width/Height fields
- Units can be 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, up to 3x3
- Query system handles multi-cell automatically

### Why Automated Abilities?

**Design Goal:** FFT-style abilities that don't interrupt flow.

**Benefits:**
- No manual ability selection interrupting combat
- Strategic depth from ability composition
- Emergent gameplay from condition combinations

**Implementation:**
- 4 ability slots per leader
- Each slot has trigger condition
- Abilities fire automatically when condition met

### Why Entity IDs Instead of Pointers?

**ECS Best Practice:** Native entity IDs prevent coupling.

**Benefits:**
- No circular references
- Query-based relationships
- Entities can be safely removed
- Proper ECS architecture

**Implementation:**
- All references use ecs.EntityID (uint32)
- Query functions return []ecs.EntityID
- No entity pointers in components
