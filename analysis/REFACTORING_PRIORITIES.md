# Refactoring Priorities Before Implementing Todos

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-01
**Current Roadmap Completion:** 73%
**Target:** Determine what must be refactored before implementing todos.txt items

---

## Executive Summary

### Critical Findings

1. **Entity Template System (50% ‚Üí 100%) BLOCKS Spawning System** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Current spawning uses hardcoded MonsterTemplates[0] or random selection
   - Generic factory needed for probability-based spawning with difficulty ratings
   - **Must complete before implementing spawning todo (line 31)**

2. **Squad Combat System Requires Major Refactoring** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Current 1v1 combat system incompatible with "command several squads" requirement (line 25)
   - 40-60 hours effort for full implementation
   - Partially blocks AI, spawning quality, and balance features
   - Can be implemented incrementally alongside other work

3. **Quick Wins Available** ‚úÖ
   - GUI Button Factory: 2 hours to complete
   - Status Effects Quality: 2 hours to complete
   - Neither blocks todos, but improves maintainability

## Priority Order (By Blocking Impact)

### PRIORITY 1: Complete Entity Template System (4 hours) üî¥ CRITICAL

**Status:** 50% ‚Üí 100%
**Blocks:** Spawning system implementation
**File:** `entitytemplates/creators.go`

**Why Critical:**
- Todo line 31: "Develop a spawning system... Use probabilities"
- Current system has 4 specialized `CreateXFromTemplate()` functions
- Generic factory enables data-driven, probability-based entity creation
- Foundation already exists (ComponentAdder pattern complete)

**Implementation:**
```go
// Consolidate 4 functions into generic factory
CreateEntityFromTemplate(manager, EntityConfig{
    Type: EntityCreature,
    Name: "Goblin",
    // ... other config
}, monsterData)
```

**Effort:** ~60 LOC changes, 4 hours
**Risk:** Low-Medium (well-tested pattern)
**Impact:** Unblocks entire spawning system

---

### PRIORITY 2: Decide Squad Combat Approach (Planning: 2-4 hours) üü° STRATEGIC

**Status:** 0% ‚Üí Planning Phase
**Blocks:** AI system (high), balance system (high), spawning quality (medium)
**Files:** `combat/attackingsystem.go` (needs major expansion)

**Why Strategic:**
- Todo line 25: "Create a combat system that allows squad building like Nephilim or Soul Nomad"
- Current 1v1 system incompatible with multi-squad command structure
- Impacts how entities spawn (individual vs squads) and behave (AI)

**Two Approaches:**

**Option A: Incremental Migration (Recommended)**
- Phase 1: PlayerSquad wrapper (backward compatible) - 12-16 hours
- Phase 2: Multi-squad support - 16-20 hours
- Phase 3: Squad-aware spawning & AI - 12-16 hours
- **Total:** 40-52 hours, can parallelize with other features

**Option B: Defer Squad Combat**
- Implement spawning/throwing/levels with current 1v1 system
- Refactor to squads later (more rework, but faster short-term progress)

**Recommendation:** Start Phase 1 (PlayerSquad wrapper) immediately after Entity Templates
**Why:** Provides foundation without breaking existing systems, enables squad-aware spawning

---

### PRIORITY 3: GUI Button Factory (2 hours) üü¢ QUICK WIN

**Status:** 10% ‚Üí 100%
**Blocks:** Nothing
**File:** `gui/playerUI.go`

**Why Quick Win:**
- 3 duplicate button functions ‚Üí 1 factory
- Net -35 lines (23% reduction)
- Demonstrates progress, builds momentum
- Zero dependencies on other refactorings

**Implementation:**
```go
CreateMenuButton(playerUI, ui, ButtonConfig{
    Label: "Throwables",
    WindowGetter: func(p *PlayerUI) WindowDisplay {
        return p.ItemsUI.ThrowableItemDisplay
    },
})
```

**Effort:** ~30 LOC changes, 2 hours
**Risk:** Minimal (pure structural change)
**Impact:** Maintainability improvement

---

### PRIORITY 4: Status Effects Quality Interface (2 hours) üü¢ CLEANUP

**Status:** 85% ‚Üí 100%
**Blocks:** Nothing
**Files:** `gear/stateffect.go`, `gear/itemactions.go`

**Why Cleanup:**
- Completes conceptual separation (effects ‚â† quality)
- Quality belongs at item entity level, not behavior level
- Helps spawning system by clarifying quality management

**Implementation:**
- Remove `common.Quality` embedding from StatusEffects and ItemAction interfaces
- Move quality management to item entity level
- Update spawning to set quality on items, not effects

**Effort:** ~25 LOC changes, 2 hours
**Risk:** Minimal (additive change)
**Impact:** Architectural clarity

   - Preserve `PerformAttack()` logic (don't rewrite proven math)

### Medium Risk Items
2. **Entity Template System** - LOW-MEDIUM
   - Mitigation: Keep old functions as wrappers during migration
   - Type safety: Add validation for `data any` type assertions
   - Testing: Verify all entity creation paths after changes

### Low Risk Items
3. **GUI Button Factory** - MINIMAL
4. **Status Effects Quality** - MINIMAL

## Conclusion

### Critical Actions Before Starting Todos

1. **MUST DO:** Complete Entity Template System (4 hours)
   - Unblocks spawning system (key todo line 31)
   - Enables probability-based entity generation
   - Foundation for balanced spawning

2. **SHOULD DO:** Begin Squad Combat Phase 1 (12 hours)
   - Provides foundation for "command several squads" (todo line 25)
   - Can run parallel to other feature work
   - Incremental approach reduces risk

3. **NICE TO HAVE:** Complete GUI Buttons + Status Effects (4 hours)
   - Achieves 100% roadmap completion
   - Demonstrates progress
   - Improves maintainability

### Recommended Starting Point

**Start with Priority 1 (Entity Templates)** - This unlocks the most value in shortest time.

**Total time to unblock all todos:** 8 hours (roadmap completion) + 12 hours (squad Phase 1) = 20 hours

After 20 hours of focused refactoring, all todos can be implemented without architectural blockers.
